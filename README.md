Features:
  Debug ARM assembly instructions in real-time.
  Support for assembling 32-bit instructions.
  Visual representation of execution using Logisim.
Technologies:
  Languages: Assembly, HTML
  Tools: Logisim
Setup:
  Write the assembly code in the HMTL link.
  Take the assembled machine code and paste it into the debugger in logism.
Usage:
  Load the assembly code and visualize the execution process.
